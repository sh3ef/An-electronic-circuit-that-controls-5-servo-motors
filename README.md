# An-electronic-circuit-that-controls-5-servo-motors
An electronic circuit that controls 5 servo motors, and programmed them to put all the motors at 90 degrees

**In this task**, I designed a circuit that controls five servo motors, their usefulness is based on the fact that they will be the joints for the robot arm. 
**This circuit does not contain variable resistors and is programmed to be able to move only at a rotation angle of 90 degrees.**
